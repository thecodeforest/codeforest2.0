<p>BING BONG!!!
Need to answer Causal graphs. This is different from traditional machine learnining, where the goal is map F(x) -&gt; y.</p>
<p>Inputs, Interventions (T), and Outputs. What is the causal relationship between these three variables?</p>
<p>X is what you know about the person. X -&gt; T (treatment plan -&gt; binary (treatment 1, treatment 2))</p>
<p>Challenge is you only observe one outcome. And you must impute the other outcome. And this is the crux of the counterfactual.</p>
<p>Conditional Average Treatment Effect (For someone with a specific age, there is a big difference between the two treatments). What you want to predict.</p>
<p>Average treatment effect (does not condition on any variable) (On average, this intervention is a good intervention)</p>
