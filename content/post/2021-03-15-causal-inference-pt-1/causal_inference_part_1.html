<p>Causal -&gt; Cause &amp; Effect.
Causal Inference -&gt; Draw conclusions between cause &amp; effect
A -&gt; B
B -&gt; A
Z -&gt; A
Z -&gt; B</p>
<p>Causal Inference answers the question “What would happen”? How much more beer would we sell if we buy more google ads?</p>
<p>Goal: Infer the effect of one thing on another
- Effect of treatment on disease
- Effect of website change on conversion
- Effect of climate change policy on emissions</p>
<ul>
<li>Observational studies are just more convienient.</li>
<li>Adjust/control for confounders</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you measure causal effects in observational studies?</p>
<div id="simpsons-paradox" class="section level3">
<h3>Simpson’s Paradox</h3>
<p>BING BONG!!!
Need to answer Causal graphs. This is different from traditional machine learnining, where the goal is map F(x) -&gt; y. Goal is to explain the structure.</p>
<p>Inputs, Interventions (T), and Outputs. What is the causal relationship between these three variables?</p>
<p>X is what you know about the person. X -&gt; T (treatment plan -&gt; binary (treatment 1, treatment 2))</p>
<p>Challenge is you only observe one outcome. And you must impute the other outcome. And this is the crux of the counterfactual.</p>
<p>Conditional Average Treatment Effect (For someone with a specific age, there is a big difference between the two treatments). What you want to predict.</p>
<p>Average treatment effect (does not condition on any variable) (On average, this intervention is a good intervention)</p>
