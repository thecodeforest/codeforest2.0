BING BONG!!!
Need to answer Causal graphs. This is different from traditional machine learnining, where the goal is map F(x) -> y. 

Inputs, Interventions (T), and Outputs. What is the causal relationship between these three variables? 

X is what you know about the person. X -> T (treatment plan -> binary (treatment 1, treatment 2))

Challenge is you only observe one outcome. And you must impute the other outcome. And this is the crux of the counterfactual. 

Conditional Average Treatment Effect (For someone with a specific age, there is a big difference between the two treatments). What you want to predict. 

Average treatment effect (does not condition on any variable) (On average, this intervention is a good intervention)
