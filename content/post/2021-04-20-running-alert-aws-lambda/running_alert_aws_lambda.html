<p>AWS solves one of the biggest problems within analytics: The Last Mile. This is basically “I developed something that works locally or in a cloud-based Sandbox environment” to “This is going to be accessible to others in the real-world”. The key about analytics is that value is only realized in the second stage, yet very little time is spent on it. Thus, the goal of this to highlight an AWS service that I’ve found to have many helpful applications - Lambda - through an real-life use-case.</p>
