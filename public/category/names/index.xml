&lt;div id=&#34;overview&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phil Karlton, a famous Netscape Developer (i.e., OG Google Chrome) once said, â€˜There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming thingsâ€™. I havenâ€™t done much cache invalidation, but I have named a few things â€“ and naming a person is by far the hardest of them all! Indeed, having waited two days after my own sonâ€™s birth to finally settle on a name, I wondered to what extent other new parents encountered the same struggles. Are there shortcuts or heuristics that others use to simplify the decision-making process, specifically cues from their immediate surroundings to help guide their choices when choosing a baby name? This question motivated me to look into the nuances of naming conventions over the past century in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, in this post, weâ€™ll investigate the influence of oneâ€™s state of residence on the frequency with which certain names occur. Weâ€™ll also explore possible reasons for why some states have more variety in their names than others. Finally, weâ€™ll finish up in my home state of Oregon to identify the trendiest names over the past 20 years and predict whether those names will remain trendy in the future. From a technical standpoint, weâ€™ll cover some central, bread-and-butter topics in data science, including trend detection, false discovery rates, web scraping, time-series forecasting, and geovisualization. Letâ€™s get started!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;people-born-in-oregon-are-named-after-trees&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People Born in Oregon are Named after Trees&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weâ€™ll begin by downloading more than 110 years of US name data from ðŸŽ„ &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thecodeforest&#34;&gt;the codeforest github repo&lt;/a&gt; ðŸŒ´. Our dataset is published yearly by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/limits.html&#34;&gt;Social Security Administration&lt;/a&gt;, and it contains a count of all names that occur more than five times by year within each US state. Letâ€™s get started by loading relevant libraries and pulling our data into R.&lt;/p&gt;
